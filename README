Overview:

This project contains open hardware design files for a baseboard supporting NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson Orin NX System on Modules (SoMs). 
The board break-routes the typical IO interfaces from the SoM.
Additionally, it exposes an expansion connector which allows it to be integrated with external processing modules using PCIe or low-speed interfaces.

The design files were preapared in KiCad 7.x.

This version is built with extra CV processing power and is built with the 

Key features:

* Two USB PD ports
* DC Power connector
* MIPI CSI-2 interfaces on 50-pin connectors with configurable lane mapping
* Micro HDMI connector
* USB-C 10 Gbps with USB PD and DP
* USB-C 10 Gbps
* USB-C UART with USB PD
* M.2 key M
* Dual Coral TPU
* 1Gb Ethernet with PoE
* Custom expansion connector
* RTC battery backup

Project structure:

The main directory contains KiCad PCB project files, a LICENSE, and a README.
The remaining files are stored in the following directories:

* `lib` - contains the component libraries
* `img` - contains graphics for this README
* `doc` - contains schematics in pdf form
* `assets` - contains visual assets for showcasing this design on [Open Hardware Portal](https://openhardware.antmicro.com).
